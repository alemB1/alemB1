### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alem :D

I'm 22 years old student at FIT Mostar, trying to learn as much as possible about everything related to IT. I love meeting like-minded people and learning new things from them and improving my current skillset. Currently I'm looking into the whole process of writing fullstack web apps.
