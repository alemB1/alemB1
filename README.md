### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alem :D

I'm 21 years old student at FIT Mostar, trying to learn as much as possible about everything related to IT. I love meeting like-minded people and learning new things from them and improving my current skillset. Currently I'm looking into the whole process of writing fullstack web apps.

## Current skills

* I'm currently learning React
* I'm looking for help with Kali Linux and things related to penetration testing

* Fun fact about me: I have been playing the electric guitar for about 5 years now, and I enjoy spending time either in the gym or jamming to my favourite songs :D
